# NEAT-FLAPPY-BIRD
An AI that plays flappy bird! Using the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) python module.

# About NEAT
Neuroevolution, i.e. evolving artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks with genetic algorithms, has been highly effective in reinforcement learning tasks, particularly those with hidden state information.

# Instructions
Simply run *flappy_bird_neat.py* and watch an AI start training itself to play the game of flappy bird!

# Resources
A research paper by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen is attached for reference.
